# Machine Learning Intro
This repo is me exploring some simple machine learning with Python.

If you want to check it out yourself download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

You can open up a terminal window and type `jupyter notebook` which will start the notebook server. If you get an error `zsh: command not found: jupyter` you'll need to do some additional configurations. [Here](https://superuser.com/questions/1493257/cannot-open-jupyter-notebook-in-the-new-zsh-shell-in-macos) is a link that might help you with this configuration, however, this isn't a necessary step. You can just open the Anaconda Navigator app and launch Jupyter. You'll then see the Jupyter Dashboard appear.

Next, create a new notebook for python. Click `Desktop` (or anything place you want to place this project) then click `New` and `Python 3` in the dropdown.
